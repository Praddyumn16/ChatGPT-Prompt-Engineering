# Building a chatbot

Throughout the course, we used a helper function which just takes 1 prompt as input and produced the output;
```python
def get_completion(prompt, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"):
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}] # just pass a single prompt given by the user as a value to the messages parameter
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model=model,
        messages=messages,
        temperature=0, # this is the degree of randomness of the model's output
    )
    return response.choices[0].message["content"]
```

But, the ChatGPT model is actually trained to a take a series or a list of messages as input and they can be from different roles.

When we use the ChatGPT interface, our messages are the user messages and the response from ChatGPT are the assistant messages. The system role sets the behaviour of the assistant.
