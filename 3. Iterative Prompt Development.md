# Iterative Prompt Development  

There is no perfect prompt. Even though you write the most clear and to the point prompt in the first attempt, you might still want to refine it further to improve the response that you're getting.

Different ways of limiting the size of response:
- under 50 words  
- at most 3 sentences (works best)
- under 250 words

We have define a fact sheet here like this:

Now, this is how the prompts are improved in every iteration:
Fixing the length of response | Making it suitable for target audience | Extracting information and organizing it in a different manner

Let's look at another example on improving the prompts for summarizing this product review:
```python
prod_review = """
Got this panda plush toy for my daughter's birthday, \
who loves it and takes it everywhere. It's soft and \ 
super cute, and its face has a friendly look. It's \ 
a bit small for what I paid though. I think there \ 
might be other options that are bigger for the \ 
same price. It arrived a day earlier than expected, \ 
so I got to play with it myself before I gave it \ 
to her.
"""
```

Focus on Shipping and Delivery | Focus on Price and Value | Focus on Product Experience

- We can also use "extract" instead of summarize to get the exact information from the review for a specific department without summarizing it. And to have multiple prodcuts reviewed, we can use the following code where the reviews array contains all the reviews:
```python
for i in range(len(reviews)):
    prompt = f"""
    Your task is to generate a short summary of a product \ 
    review from an ecommerce site. 

    Summarize the review below, delimited by triple \
    backticks in at most 30 words. 

    Review: ```{reviews[i]}```
    """

    response = get_completion(prompt)
    print(i, response, "\n")
```
