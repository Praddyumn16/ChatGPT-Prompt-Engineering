# Iterative Prompt Development  

There is no perfect prompt. Even though you write the most clear and to the point prompt in the first attempt, you might still want to refine it further to improve the response that you're getting.

Different ways of limiting the size of response:
- under 50 words  
- at most 3 sentences (works best)
- under 250 words

We have define a fact sheet here like this:

Now, this is how the prompts are improved in every iteration:
Fixing the length of response | Making it suitable for target audience | Extracting information and organizing it in a different manner
